### Features

* Added routes, lazy loading, divided sections into components. Need to resolve loading the scenes (lazy or normal) and then implement some sort of pseudo-authentication. ([a3b30ac](https://github.com/jmahc/that-react-app-you-want/commit/a3b30acd34f9964c02683e5f22c6db116cb91ee3))
* Having trouble with webpack building via `npm run start`.  Seems to be HTMLWebpackPlugin related. ([027a8bc](https://github.com/jmahc/that-react-app-you-want/commit/027a8bcd0344d2c0828c1987bc5f6c44ce6e7ad0))
* Npm run start now works. PostCSS needs some work ([e98925b](https://github.com/jmahc/that-react-app-you-want/commit/e98925bfaa4823b4f101770b45144750fad2cb29))
* Packagejson reorganization. ([cbc40b3](https://github.com/jmahc/that-react-app-you-want/commit/cbc40b37df516a0f68237ab90b90d285d61613a5))
* Router works.  Working on global CSS. Working on authentication for locked routes.  Soon to be done. ([6c98c44](https://github.com/jmahc/that-react-app-you-want/commit/6c98c443cb02ce3b280ef0292e806ad8f9b25b4f))
* Updating npm packages, metadata files in the root and the webpack config directory.  Vendor config works but will need to fix the other webpack configurations. ([6f0b8b9](https://github.com/jmahc/that-react-app-you-want/commit/6f0b8b9ab33aff5a0044427db1d288c7fff51604))

# Change Log
You might be asking yourself:

- "Hey, last time I was here, there was the solution to my struggling business' needs!  Where could it have gone?"

Might try checking this document.  I could have recorded why stuff changed.  Or maybe, just maybe, I didn't.

**No releases just yet. Calm down, buckaroo.**
