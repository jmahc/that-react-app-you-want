## What do you want to see from this?
Please fill free to open a card, or shoot me an email (found in the `package.json` file with tips, ideas and improvements!).

Hopefully you guys are enjoying it!

## Getting started
For you [yarn] losers:
1. `yarn` - install dependencies.
2. `yarn run dev:vendor` - **for quicker development builds** due to the DLL's generated.
3. `yarn run start` or `yarn run dev` - start development server.
4. `yarn run build` - build for production.

For you [npm] nerds:
1. `npm i` - install dependencies.
2. `npm run dev:vendor` - **for quicker development builds** due to the DLL's generated.
3. `npm run start` or `npm run dev` - start development server.
4. `npm run build` - build for production.
