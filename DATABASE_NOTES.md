## Post-Tutorial

Take a look at the `Vision Simple Search` and see if we need to break out the simple search ES query into multiple calls from the API.

- When doing the training, OK to do the admin/setup process.
- Creating new "documents" to firehose the Winston console logging into Kibana.
- Read/writing to ES.
- NO need to investigate the SQL query that pushes data into ES

## SQL Database

Use SQL01 because it has more RAM + processing power.

- Create new Vision database with a new "stripped-down" `User` table and get it to the bare-bones
- Do away with the old one.
- Optional: Do PostgreSQL versus MSSQL.
